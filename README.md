## **About the Repository**

#### *Hello everyone and welcome to the Horiseon Repository!* 

My name is Dexter James Paloma and I'll explain what this repository is all about. So our goal with Horiseon is to market our search engine optimization. With that being said our company helps putting your buisness out there on the web and finding the customers you need.
